//! In Git, a tree object is used to represent the state of a directory at a specific point in time.
//! It stores information about the files and directories within that directory, including their names,
//! permissions, and the IDs of the objects that represent their contents.
//!
//! A tree object can contain other tree objects as well as blob objects, which represent the contents
//! of individual files. The object IDs of these child objects are stored within the tree object itself.
//!
//! When you make a commit in Git, you create a new tree object that represents the state of the
//! repository at that point in time. The parent of the new commit is typically the tree object
//! representing the previous state of the repository.
//!
//! Git uses the tree object to efficiently store and manage the contents of a repository. By
//! representing the contents of a directory as a tree object, Git can quickly determine which files
//! have been added, modified, or deleted between two points in time. This allows Git to perform
//! operations like merging and rebasing more quickly and accurately.

    /// # GitLink
    /// Gitlink, also known as a submodule, is a feature in Git that allows you to include a Git
    /// repository as a subdirectory within another Git repository. This is useful when you want to
    /// incorporate code from another project into your own project, without having to manually copy
    /// the code into your repository.
    ///
    /// When you add a submodule to your Git repository, Git stores a reference to the other
    /// repository at a specific commit. This means that your repository will always point to a
    /// specific version of the other repository, even if changes are made to the submodule's code
    /// in the future.
    ///
    /// To work with a submodule in Git, you use commands like git submodule add, git submodule
    /// update, and git submodule init. These commands allow you to add a submodule to your repository,
    /// update it to the latest version, and initialize it for use.
    ///
    /// Submodules can be a powerful tool for managing dependencies between different projects and
    /// components. However, they can also add complexity to your workflow, so it's important to
    /// understand how they work and when to use them.
