#Build

This project uses Bazel to build the pipeline. Below is a simple usage guide:

1. Use cargo install to download crates and generate Cargo.lock from the repository:
   `$ cargo install`

2. Now we can run bazel sync to pin cargo dependencies as Bazel targets:
   `$ CARGO_BAZEL_REPIN=1 bazel sync --only=crate_index`

   You should run this command **whenever you update dependencies** in Cargo files. We can also use a Bazel query to examine targets generated by crate_universe:

   `$ bazel query @crate_index//...`

3. Finally we can build and test the mega:

    `$ bazel build //:mega`
