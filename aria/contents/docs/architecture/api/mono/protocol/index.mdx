## Discovering References

When the client initially connects the server will immediately respond with a version number, and a listing of each reference it has (all branches and tags) along with the object name that each reference currently points to.

As the [git protocol docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/http-protocol) says:

>HTTP clients that support the "smart" protocol (or both the "smart" and "dumb" protocols) MUST discover references by making a parameterized request for the info/refs file of the repository.

>The request MUST contain exactly one query parameter, service=$servicename, where $servicename MUST be the service name the client wishes to contact to complete the operation. The request MUST NOT contain additional query parameters.

    ```bash
    GET $GIT_URL/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack HTTP/1.0
    ```
Smart server reply:

    ```bash
    S: 200 OK
    S: Content-Type: application/x-git-upload-pack-advertisement
    S: Cache-Control: no-cache
    S:
    S: 001e# service=git-upload-pack\n
    S: 0000
    S: 004895dcfa3633004da0049d3d0fa03f80589cbcaf31 refs/heads/maint\0multi_ack\n
    S: 003fd049f6c27a2244e12041955e262a404c7faba355 refs/heads/master\n
    S: 003c2cb58b79488a98d2721cea644875a8dd0026b115 refs/tags/v1.0\n
    S: 003fa3c2e2402b99163d1d59756e5f207ae21cccba4c refs/tags/v1.0^{}\n
    S: 0000
    ```

## Smart Service git-receive-pack

Pushing data to a server will invoke the receive-pack process on the server, which will allow the client to tell it which references it should update and then send all the data the server will need for those new references to be complete. Once all the data is received and validated, the server will then update its references to what the client specified.

    ```bash
    GET **/git-receive-pack
    ```

## Smart Service git-upload-pack

When one Git repository wants to get data that a second repository has, the first can fetch from the second. This operation determines what data the server has that the client does not then streams that data down to the client in Pack file format.

    ```bash
    GET **/git-upload-pack
    ```
